//Exercise #2 â€“ Create your address using String and StringBuilder
//
//        Define "StringAndStringBuilder" class under "WhiteboardModel" module
//
//Add and implement "String constructMyAddressUsingString()" method, in which you are going to construct a String object from each word fragment of your address using String concatenation
//
//                Add and implement "String constructMyAddressUsingStringBuilder()" method, in which you are going to construct a String object from each word fragment of your address using StringBuilder
//
//                Write client code that invokes both methods above and display them to the console
//
//                Compare the return values of both methods using both "==" and ".equals(..)"
